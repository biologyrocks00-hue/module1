  <div class="mt-3 text-start" id="desc1">
    <p>
      The cell wall is the outermost layer of the cell, characterized by its
      tough, rigid matrix. It acts as a protective shield and a structural
      skeleton for the plant.
    </p>
    <ul style="text-align: justify">
      <li>
        Composition: It is primarily built from a complex blend of
        polysaccharides, including cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Layered Architecture: The wall is typically organized into two distinct
        layers:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Primary Cell Wall: The flexible but strong initial layer composed
            mainly of cellulose.
          </li>
          <li>
            Middle Lamella: The outermost layer that acts like "glue," binding
            adjacent plant cells together.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Key Functions of the Cell Wall</h5>
    <p>
      The cell wall is far more than just a container; it is a multi-functional
      structure essential for a plant's survival:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-group-numbered" style="text-align: justify">
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <strong>Mechanical Protection.</strong> It serves as a sturdy shield,
        protecting the delicate internal organelles from physical damage and
        environmental stress.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <strong>Regulated Circulation.</strong> As a semipermeable barrier, it
        facilitates the movement of vital resources—such as water, minerals, and
        essential nutrients—throughout the plant tissue.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <strong>Nutrient Storage.</strong> It acts as a reservoir for specific
        elements that the cell may need to draw upon later.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <strong>Structural Support.</strong> By providing rigidity and
        stiffness, the cell wall allows plants to grow tall and maintain their
        shape without a skeleton.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="PlasmaMembrane">
  <p style="text-align: justify">
    Nested securely between the rigid cell wall and the interior cytoplasm lies
    the <strong>cell membrane</strong>, often referred to as the plasma
    membrane. While the cell wall provides the "shell," the membrane provides
    the "gatekeeping."
  </p>
  <ul class="list-group-numbered">
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <strong>Composition.</strong> It consists of a sophisticated lipid
      bilayer, a double layer of specialized fat molecules.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <strong>Molecular Makeup.</strong> The primary building blocks of this
      bilayer are <strong>phospholipids</strong>, interspersed with
      <strong>cholesterol</strong> molecules that help maintain the membrane's
      fluidity and stability.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <strong>Selective Permeability.</strong> Because it is semipermeable, it
      precisely controls which molecules can enter or exit the cytoplasm,
      ensuring the cell maintains its internal chemical balance.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Functions</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Separates cell wall from cytoplasm.</li>
    <li>Regulates the movement of substances within and out of the cell.</li>
    <li>Provide a shield against external damage.</li>
    <li>Helps in the transport of cellular molecules.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div id="Nucleus">
  <p style="text-align: justify">
    The nucleus of a plant cell is a membrane-bound organelle that is present in
    the cytoplasm. The main parts of the nucleus are the nuclear envelope,
    nucleoplasm, nucleolus, and chromatin. The labeled nucleolus of plant cell
    is shown below.
  </p>
  <h5>Functions</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>It contains genetic or hereditary material.</li>
    <li>Control cellular activities.</li>
    <li>Plays a crucial role in protein synthesis.</li>
    <li>
      By replicating DNA and organizing ribosomes, the nucleus has an important
      role in cell division.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div id="Chloroplast">
  <p style="text-align: justify">
    The chloroplast is an organelle in plant cells that carries out
    photosynthesis and converts the light energy of the sun into chemical
    energy. It is a double membrane organelle that contains a fluid called the
    stroma. The stroma is composed of thylakoids that are stacked up to form
    grana. A labelled plant cell chloroplast is shown here.
  </p>
  <h5>Functions</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>It is the central site of photosynthesis.</li>
    <li>
      It regulates various metabolic processes in plants, including amino acids,
      hormones, and lipid synthesis.
    </li>
    <li>
      In the stroma, during the Calvin cycle, carbon dioxide is converted into
      glucose.
    </li>
    <li>
      The chloroplast is responsible for releasing oxygen into the atmosphere.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div id="Vacuole">
  <p style="text-align: justify">
    Vacuoles are membrane-bound organelles found in the cytoplasm of the cell.
    These are vesicles filled with fluid. Vacuoles are also found in animal
    cell, but plant cell vacuoles are larger than animal cell vacuoles. The
    membrane around the vacuole is known as the Tonoplast. The inner part of the
    vacuole is filled with fluid called cell sap. The vacuole in a plant cell
    labelled diagram is shown below.
  </p>
  <h5>Functions</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>
      It stores water, sugars, enzymes, pigments, inorganic salts, alkaloids,
      and waste products.
    </li>
    <li>It regulates the turgor pressure of plant cells.</li>
    <li>
      It plays a crucial role in cell enlargement and growth during plant
      growth.
    </li>
    <li>It balances the pH within the cell.</li>
    <li>It helps to dispose of the harmful toxins from the cell.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div id="Mitochondria">
  <p style="text-align: justify">
    Mitochondria are known as the powerhouse of the cell. The mitochondria in
    plant cells are a double-layered, spherical oval organelle. The inner
    membrane of mitochondria has many folds known as cristae. Within the
    cristae, a fluid is found called the matrix. The labeled diagram of the
    mitochondria in plant cell is elaborated here.
  </p>
  <h5>Functions</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Generates energy to be used by the cell.</li>
    <li>
      It acts as the means of calcium storage, crucial for signaling activities,
      cell growth, and division.
    </li>
    <li>Releases certain proteins to regulate apoptosis.</li>
  </ul>
